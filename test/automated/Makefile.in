## Ignore any test errors so we can continue to test other files.

## individual test, but not when running check.)
## But compilation errors are always fatal.
##
## I'd prefer to use -emacs -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit rather
## than || true, since the former makes problems more obvious.
## I'd also prefer to @-hide the grep part and not the
## ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit part.
##
## We need to use $loadfile because:
## i) -L :$srcdir -l basename does not work, because we have files whose
## basename duplicates a file in lisp/ (eg eshell.el).
## ii) Although -l basename will automatically load .el or .elc,
## -l ./basename treats basename as a literal file (it would be nice
## to change this).
##
## Beware: it approximates `no-byte-compile', so watch out for false-positives!
